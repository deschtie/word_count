Word Frequency Code Review

Desire Perrault

This app takes a word and sentence entered by the user and evaluates the frequency. When it is finished, the frequency counter will return the amount of times your word appears.

I am using the app nitrous.io and I have to change the port # from the default in order for it to run. If using on a mac/without nitrous.io, you will need to remove this to view the app on the Sinatra default.
